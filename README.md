# Photography & Videography Portfolio React Project

### What is this repo for?

It is a photography & videography portfolio test website.

More specifically, it is a personal project using React as a way to practise my skills.

It is a desktop-first website, however, I have tried to make it a responsive design to work on desktops, mobiles and tablets.
